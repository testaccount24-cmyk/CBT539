Sam,

This is a mini-app for data center folk which I call "DSNUSAGE:
or Who Did What to This Data Set?"  It reads raw SMF with SAS and
looks for all uses of a fully or partially qualified dsname.
Then it lists all jobs/userids/system tasks that opened, renamed,
deleted, altered, cataloged or uncataloged that data set or sets.

That's just the program part.  The mini-app is to roll it out to
colleagues so they can do their own searches.  Two additional
files accomplish this, a REXX exec and a Word document.

All three files are attached below, and I'll be happy to take
questions.
